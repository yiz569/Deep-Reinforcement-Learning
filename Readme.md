## Deep Reinforcement Learning via Market Making Research Project

### Alpha Vantage API

We get historical and real-time trading data from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co).

### Limit Order Book

A limit order book is a record of unexecuted limit orders maintained by the security specialist who works at the exchange. We made a model of the limit order book simulating the real manipulations like add, remove, etc.

### Visualization

We used TradingGym toolkit for training and backtesting the reinforcement learning algorithms. This toolkit imitates
the framework form of OpenAI Gym and helps visualize the process.
